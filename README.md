Hey, you've found my repo, thanks for looking! This is presently a work in progress but you're welcomed to look around
<br />
This is a learning project, primarily intended to do two things:<br />
emsp 1) Resuse as much code as possible
emsp 2) Get exposure to GraphQL (and as a sub-point, learn more about Jamf Protect's API, specifically)
<br />
<br />
This tool does a few things, and hopefully will do more eventually but, for the time being, it primarily opens up, has you authenticate, then presents a list of options to collect data from your Jamf Protect instance.
<br />
This is useful for quick report generation or for Jamf Protect admins that might not have access to a SIEM or simply don't have one set up, yet.
<br />
Let me know if there are any features you'd like to see added
